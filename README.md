# Disk Sort

it's a simple algorithm for sorting data on disk with limited memory. this example uses a list to mimic computer memory.

```
./gen_files.py
generate data from 10 to 100000 and write to 10 files

./disk_sort.py
sort data in each file, and stored in temp files. then merge all sorted files to file parts.
```
